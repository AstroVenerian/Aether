# Now Presenting... Aether!
   Welcome to my Aether Github Repository. Aether serves as the hosting grounds for my main website using GitHub Pages. Aether also contains blogs for general discussions, image galleries for astrophotography, and even serves as a means to live stream or video content relating to astronomy or astrophotography.

## Who am I?

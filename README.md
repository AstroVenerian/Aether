# Now Presenting... Aether!
   Welcome to my Aether Github Repository. Aether serves as the hosting grounds for my main website using GitHub Pages. Aether also contains blogs for general discussions, image galleries for astrophotography, and even serves as a means to live stream or video content relating to astronomy or astrophotography.

## Who am I?
   My name is Jeriko! I am an undergraduate college student that is currently studying Space Studies at American Public University. I used to study Computer Science but I felt as if an Astronomy related field world fit my passions more. I have had an astronomical interest in space from a very young age. My mother used to take me to planetariums in which they hosted shows and even to tours to a gravitational wave observatory. I have always wanted to understand how the universe works and this is the perfect field of study for that.

## What can be found on Aether?
   As I have said before, this will serve as a hosting grounds for my main website using GitHub Pages. This may include links to third-party pages (such as but not limited to Twitter, Pensight, Linktree, TikTok, & YouTube). There may be blogs hosted on the website for general discussions but these have strict guidelines that must be followed. (Guidelines Can Be Found Here -> Https://Mayeaux.Cloud/Guidelines/Community) Aether will be used as a means to livestream content in regards to astrophotography. Join to get a beautiful view of the planets! I will use this as a video blogging platform as well to provide educational content relating to astronomy and computer science.

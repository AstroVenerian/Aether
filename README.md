# Aether
     Welcome to my Aether Github Repository. This repository serves as the hosting grounds for my main website using GitHub Pages. The website contains blogs for general discussions, image galleries for astrophotography, and even serves as a means to live stream or video content relating to astronomy or astrophotography.
